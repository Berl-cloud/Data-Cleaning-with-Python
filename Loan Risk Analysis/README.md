# Loan Risk Analysis

## About Project

The Loan Risk Analysis project focuses on analyzing and visualizing loan data from Blue Bank, a US-based bank, that supplies loans to individuals. The goal is to provide a report for the loan department on borrowers who may have issues paying back the loan.

## Problem Statement

Blue Bank supplies loans to individuals but lacks sufficient reporting on the riskiness of borrowers. This project aims to address this issue by analyzing the provided loan data and presenting the information through a Tableau dashboard.

## Dataset

The loan data is stored in an json file named "loan_data_json.json" with a file size of 761 KB. You can access the dataset through the following link:
[loan_data_json.json](https://finch-groundhog-9245.squarespace.com/s/loan_data_json.json)

## Approach

The loan risk analysis project follows these steps:

1. Data Acquisition: We downloaded the "loan_data_json.json" file from the provided link.

2. Data Quality Assesment: We wrote python codes to assess the quality of the data.

3. Data Cleaning: we cleaned the loan data by performing tasks such as formatting data types.

4. Mathematical Computations: We performed some mathematical computations based on the data and added new columns to the data which helped us to achieve our goal with the dashboard.

5. Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation: We exported the cleaned dataset and loaded it unto tableau to build charts for the dashboard.

## Usage

To use the Loan Risk Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. Download the "loan_data_json.json" file from the provided link.

2. Install the necessary Python libraries mentioned in the project.

3. Open Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE that supports Jupyter Notebook format.

4. Load the dataset into your Python environment using appropriate libraries (e.g. json).

5. Follow the code and analysis provided in the Jupyter Notebook file to process the data.

6. Export the cleaned dataset as a csv file.

7. Develop a dashboard to display the monthly costs, mothly sales and profits by the various categories.
