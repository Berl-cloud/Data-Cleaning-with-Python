# Sales Data Analysis

## About Project

The Sales Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data from Value Inc, a retail store that sells household items worldwide in bulk. The goal is to provide the Sales Manager with insights into sales performance, monthly costs, monthly sales and profits.

## Problem Statement

The Sales Manager at Value Inc lacks sales reporting and requires a comprehensive understanding of the current sales. They are unaware of monthly costs, monthly sales and profits. The project aims to address these challenges by analyzing the provided sales data and presenting the information through a dashboard.

## Dataset

The sales data is stored in an Excel sheet named "transactions.csv" with a file size of 153 MB. You can access the dataset through the following link:
[transactions.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i6MQZmXUuqyqGjSGbsPrNKV-eJPAhx-U/view?usp=sharing)

## Approach

The sales data analysis project follows these steps:

1. Data Acquisition: We downloaded the "transactions.csv" file from the provided link.

2. Data Quality Assesment: We wrote python codes to assess the quality of the data.

3. Data Cleaning: we cleaned the sales data by performing tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, formatting data types and correcting inconsistencies.

4. Mathematical Computations: We performed some mathematical computations based on the data and added new columns to the data which helped us to achieve our goal with the dashboard.

5. Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation: We exported the cleaned dataset and loaded it unto tableau to build charts for the dashboard.

## Usage

To use the Sales Data Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. Download the "transactions.csv" file from the provided link.

2. Install the necessary Python libraries mentioned in the project.

3. Open Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE that supports Jupyter Notebook format.

4. Load the dataset into your Python environment using appropriate libraries (e.g., Pandas).

5. Follow the code and analysis provided in the Jupyter Notebook file to clean the data and perform all the mathematical computations.

6. Export the cleaned dataset as a csv file.

7. Develop a dashboard to display the monthly costs, mothly sales and profits by the various categories.

## Python and Tableau Skills Learnt

Throughout the development of the Sales Data Analysis project, several Python skills were acquired and honed. Some of the key Python skills learned during this project include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing: Using Python libraries like Pandas to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies in the sales data.

- Working with large datasets: Handling and processing a large dataset (153 MB) efficiently using Python's data manipulation capabilities.

- Calculations and mathematical operations: Performing calculations for monthly costs, monthly sales, and profits per various categories using Python's mathematical operators and functions.

- Jupyter Notebook: Working with Jupyter Notebook environment to write and execute Python code and document analysis steps.

- Handling external datasets: Downloading and loading an external dataset (transactions.csv) into Python for analysis and data manipulation.

- Python libraries: Installing and using various Python libraries and dependencies required for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.

- Data Connection: Connecting to a CSV file to extract and import data into Tableau for visualization.

- Visualization Design: Creating visually appealing and effective charts, graphs, and dashboards using Tableau's drag-and-drop interface. This includes selecting appropriate chart types, customizing visual properties, and utilizing features like filters and parameters to interact with data.

- Interactive Dashboards: Designing interactive dashboards by incorporating actions, filters, and tooltips to enable users to explore and analyze data dynamically.

These Python and Tableau skills are valuable for data analysis tasks, and they can be applied to a wide range of projects and domains beyond the Sales Data Analysis project.
